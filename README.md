# Fear-The-Night-with-Bigger-Backpack
Fear The Night (with Simple UI, Magoli CompoPack, and Bigger Backpack) is a mod where the zombies mostly come out at night (pretty much EVERY night),
and sleep in the day. Expect there to be a lot of zombies. Zombies drop coin for you to spend. Prepare your base 
because the zombies are going to WRECK it. Pray you survive the night!

You can still grind for resources if you want, but this mod makes it possible to skip the grind by earning money
killing zombies and spending it for what you need to build your base. Players are given a special vending machine
that sells resources and gear upon completion of a quest. (as of version 1.0)
